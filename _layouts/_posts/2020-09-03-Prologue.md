Hello,

I have been meaning to start my own page to record my learning adventures for a while now, and it is finally happening! 
This is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and I have gotten this far by using the comprehensive and *[easy-to-follow guide]*(jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages) created by Jonathan Mcglone.
My plans for future learning and explorations include completing the following tutorials and courses: 
* Learning Python by [creating 5 games](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-python-by-building-5-games/)
* Creating an [interactive game](https://opensource.com/article/20/5/python-games) using Python and JupyterNotebook
* Completing the [12 hour Data Science course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-data-science-course-matplotlib-pandas-numpy/) 

I hope you learn something new by following me in my learning journey!

**Are you ready to dive in?**

Until next time,
Nish
