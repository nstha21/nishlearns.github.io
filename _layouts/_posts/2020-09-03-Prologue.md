Hello,

<p> I have been meaning to start my own page to record my learning adventures for a while now, and it is finally happening! </p>
<p> This is powered by <a href = http://jekyllrb.com> Jekyll</a>, and I have gotten this far by using the comprehensive and <i><a href= jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages>easy-to-follow guide </a></i>created by Jonathan Mcglone.</p>
<p> My plans for future learning and explorations include completing the following tutorials and courses: 
* Learn [Alloy](alloytools.org/tutorials/online) (technically for my EECS4312 - Software Engineering Requirements class...)
* Learning Python by [creating 5 games](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-python-by-building-5-games/)
* Creating an [interactive game](https://opensource.com/article/20/5/python-games) using Python and JupyterNotebook
* Completing the [12 hour Data Science course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-data-science-course-matplotlib-pandas-numpy/) </p>

I hope you learn something new by following me in my learning journey!

**Are you ready to dive in?**

Until next time,
Nish
